# Personal Assistant Chat Application

## Description
The **Personal Assistant Chat Application** is a desktop-based project built using C# and Windows Forms. It is designed to simulate a conversational assistant that responds to basic queries. Due to OpenAI's API cost limitations, the application currently uses predefined responses for demonstration purposes. This project showcases skills in UI design, application logic, and integration with APIs.

## Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface**:  
  Displays user and assistant messages in visually distinct chat bubbles.
- **Predefined Responses**:  
  The assistant can answer simple questions like:
  - "Hi"
  - "What is AI?"
  - "Who are you?"
- **Login Functionality**:  
  Secures access to the application. Use the following credentials:
  - **Username**: `ishdeep`
  - **Password**: `password123`
- **Exit Button**:  
  Allows users to close the application easily.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
4. Run the application using `Ctrl+F5`.
5. Log in using the provided credentials:
   - **Username**: `ishdeep`
   - **Password**: `password123`
6. Start chatting by typing simple queries in the chatbox, such as:
   - "Hi"
   - "How are you?"
   - "What is AI?"

## Future Enhancements
